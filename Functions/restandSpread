When we see "..." in the code, it is either rest parameters or the spread syntax.

There’s an easy way to distinguish between them:

When ... is at the end of function parameters, it’s “rest parameters” and gathers the rest of the list of arguments into an array.
When ... occurs in a function call or alike, it’s called a “spread syntax” and expands an array into a list.
Use patterns:

Rest parameters are used to create functions that accept any number of arguments.
The spread syntax is used to pass an array to functions that normally require a list of many arguments.
Together they help to travel between a list and an array of parameters with ease.

All arguments of a function call are also available in “old-style” arguments: array-like iterable object.
